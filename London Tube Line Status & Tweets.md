#London Tube Line Status & Tweets

You're a Londoner who makes regular use of the tube, and a particlar line or two on a regular basis. You'd like to find out the status of the line(s) relevant to you before you make your next journey but don't want to have to switch between TFL and Twitter to get the latest on what's happening. That's where our app comes in...

##John, Will, Ed and Lee are building an app that will:-


* Allow you to select the tube lines tha are important to you
* See the TFL status AND the latest tweets relating to your line(s) at a glance
* Check for upcoming planned maintenance and closures
* Do all this in a mobile firendly format as well as on you desktop

####What resources will we use?
TFL provides a basic line status update API which can tell us about the current status for each of the lines. It also has information on planned maintenance and line closures that are coming up.

We can use Facbeook as a registration option for our users as well as offering them a registration and login with a username and/or email.

Tube lines all have their own dedicated Twitter handle and so can be queried in relation to the lines that are of interest to the user and presented side by side along with the line status information from the TFL API.

###We will be using the following technologies:-
* Skeleton CSS
*  Node/Express.js
*  Mongoose models
*  Twitter API
*  TFL API
*  Angular
*  SCSS
