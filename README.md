# WDI London Project 3

Project 3: Collaboratively built a MEAN stack app

The objective of this project was too:

* Use Mongo, Node & Express to build a server-side API
* Include authentication to restrict access to appropriate users â€¢ Include at least one referenced or embedded sub-document

For this project I created a Transport for London real time tube information mobile app, whereby I pulled in the TFL API and Twitter API to deliver real time line information for users. Link to project: https://twitterforlondon.herokuapp.com/
